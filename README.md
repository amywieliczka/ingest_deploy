ingest_deploy
=============

Ansible, packer and vagrant project for building and running ingest environment
on AWS and locally.
Currently only the ansible is working, need to get a local vagrant version
working....

### Dependencies

Tools:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (Version X.X)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (Version X.X)
* [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrnat-vbguest/) (`vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`)
* [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home) (Version X.X)

- if using VirtualBox, install the vagrant-vbguest 

UCLDC Harvesting operations guide
=================================


add monitoring user
--------------------------------

pull the ucldc/ingest_deploy project
Get the ansible vault password from Mark. It's easiest if you create a file
(perhaps ~/.vault-password-file) to store it in and alias ansible-playbook to
ansible-playbook --vault-password-file=~/.vault-password-file. Set mode to 600)

create an htdigest entry by running

    htdigest -c tmp.pswd ingest <username>

Will prompt for password that is easy to generate with pwgen.  copy the line in tmp.pswd

Then run:

    ansible-vault --vault-password-file=~/.vault-password-file
      ingest_deploy/ansible/roles/ingest_front/vars/basic_auth_users.yml

Entries in this file are htdigest lines, preceded by a - to make a yaml list.

    ---
    basic_auth_users:
      - "u1:ingest:435srrr3db7b180366ce7e653493ca39"
      - "u1:ingest:rrrr756e5aacde0262130e79a888888c"
      - "u2:ingest:rrrr1cd0cd7rrr7a7839a5c1450bb8bc"

From a machine that can already access the ingest front machine with ssh run:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts --vault-password-file=~/.vault_pass_ingest provision_front.yml

This will install the users.digest to allow access for the monitoring user.


Adding an admin user
--------------------

add your public ssh to keys file in https://github.com/ucldc/appstrap/tree/master/cdl/ucldc-operator-keys.txt


From a machine that can already access the ingest front machine with ssh run:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts --vault-password-file=~/.vault_pass_ingest provision_front.yml

This will add your public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys for the ec2-user on
the ingest front machine.


Creating workers
----------------

You need to log onto the ingest front machine and then to the majorTom machine.
The key to access instances in the private subnet has a password, ask Mark for
it.

Log in to the majorTom machine. From here you can run the ansible playbooks to
create and provision worker machines.

First you need to activate the virtualenv in ~/workers_local/ 

    . ~/workers_local/bin/activate

Then to create some worker machines run:

    ansible-playbook --vault-password-file=~/.vault_pass_ingest -i ~/code/ingest_deploy/ansible/hosts ~/code/ingest_deploy/ansible/create_worker-stage.yml --extra-vars="count=3"

The "count=##" will set the number of instances to create.
Once this runs and the instances are in a state of "running", to get the
machines setup & running a worker process run:

    ansible-playbook --vault-password-file=~/.vault_pass_ingest -i ~/code/ec2.py ~/code/ingest_deploy/ansible/provision_worker-stage.yml --extra-vars='rq_work_queues=["normal-stage","low-stage"]'

This will provision the workers by installing required software, configurations
and start running Akara & the worker processes that listen on the queues
specified. You should see the worker processes appear in the rq monitor once
this is done.
